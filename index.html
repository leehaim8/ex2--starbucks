          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            Starbucks was founded in 1971 in Seattle's Pike Place Market by
            three friends who wanted to create a "third place" between home and
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company's name was inspired by the character of Starbuck, a mate
            on the Pequod in the novel Moby Dick.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original Starbucks siren logo was much more graphic, but it was
            changed in 1987 to the more familiar version that is seen today.
